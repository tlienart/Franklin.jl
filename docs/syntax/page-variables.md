## Overview

The general syntax to define a page variable is to write `@def varname = value` on a new line e.g.:

```
@def author = "Septimia Zenobia"
```

where you could set the variable to a string, a number, a date,... any Julia value. Definitions can span multiple lines but if they do, the subsequent lines **must** be indented e.g.:

```
@def some_str = """A string
    on several lines is ok
    but lines must be indented"""
```

You can also define them in blocks surrounded by `+++` on a new line.
The content between the `+++` markers will then be evaluated as Julia code and all assigned variables will be considered as page variables.
For instance, consider:

```julia
+++
var1 = [1, 2,
  3, 4]
var2 = "Hello goodbye"
+++
```

this block will be executed as standard Julia code and the two assignments (`var1` and `var2`) will be caught and made available as page variables of the same name.

\note{
  It is recommended to use the `+++` block syntax style instead of the `@def` page variables. Future releases of Franklin.jl will prioritize using the `+++` block syntax while the `@def` syntax will be deprecated in upcoming releases and will be low priority in fixing bugs regarding that syntax.
}

Page variables can serve multiple purposes though their main use is to be accessed from the HTML template blocks e.g.:

```html
<footer>
  This is the footer. &copy; {{fill author}}.
</footer>
```

which could be useful as a footer on all pages.

The syntax `{{ ... }}` indicates an HTML _function_, `fill` is the function name and the rest of the bracket elements are _page variables_ (here `author`) serving as arguments of the function.

\note{
  Calls without arguments such as `{{ name }}` will be interpreted in either one of two ways: first, it will check whether there is am html function `name` and if so will call it, otherwise it will check whether there is a page variable `name` and will just insert it -- it will be treated as a shortcut for `{{fill name}}`.
}

### Local and Global

_Local_ page variables denote variables that are defined on one page and directly accessible on that page. _Global_ page variables, by contrast, are directly available on _all_ pages. Any variable defined in your `config.md` file is global.

In both cases, there are _default_ page variables set by Franklin with default values which you can both change and use.
You can of course also define your own variables, both global and local.

### Defining and accessing page variables

Let us say that in `config.md`, we have

```
@def global_var_1 = "foo"
```

and that in `index.md`, we have

```
@def local_var_1 = "bar"
```

On `index.md`, you can access both variables so this:

```
{{global_var_1}} - {{local_var_1}}
```

will insert

```
foo - bar
```

On another page (say `other.md`), only `global_var_1` is directly accessible but you can still access `local_var_1` except you have to specify where it's defined (and you must use `fill` to do so):

```
{{global_var_1}} - {{fill local_var_1 index.md}}
```

The second bit says: "get `local_var_1` from `index.md`".


### Using page variables

Both local and global page variables are meant for essentially two purposes:

@@tlist
1. control the HTML template from the markdown,
1. modify how Franklin generates HTML.
@@

The second one is a bit less prevalent but, for instance, you can specify the default programming language for all code blocks so that code blocks that don't specify a language would use the default language for highlighting:

```
@def lang = "julia"
```

In the first case, you can access variables in your HTML template via one of the HTML functions such as the `fill` function shown above.

## HTML functions

HTML functions can be used in any one of your `*.html` **and** `.md` files; in particular, they can be used in any of the `_layout/*.html` files such as `head.html`.
They are always called with the syntax `{{fname pv1 pv2 ...}}` where `pv1 pv2 ...` are page variable names.

### Basic functions

A few functions are available with the `{{fill ...}}` arguably the most likely to be of use:

@@lalign
| Format | Role |
| :----: | :--: |
| `{{fill vname}}` or `{{vname}}` | place the value of page variable `vname`
| `{{fill vname rpath}}` | place the value of page variable `vname` defined at `rpath` where  `rpath` is a relative path like `blog/pg1`
| `{{insert fpath}}` | insert the content of the file at `fpath` where `fpath` is taken relative to the `_layout` folder
| `{{redirect /some/other/addr.html}}` | adds a redirect page: when a user goes to `(baseurl)/some/other/addr.html`, they will be redirected to the current page
@@

The `{{insert fpath}}` can be useful if you want to include specific HTML scaffolding on some pages, for instance in example pages you will see in the `head.html`:

```html
{{if hasmath}} {{insert head_katex.html}} {{end}}
```

the conditional blocks are explained below.

### Conditional blocks

Conditional blocks allow specifying which parts of the HTML template should be active depending on the value of the given page variable(s).
The format follows this structure:

```html
{{if vname}}
...
{{elseif vname2}}
...
{{else}}
...
{{end}}
```

where `vname` and `vname2` are expected to be page variable evaluating to a boolean.
Of course you don't have to specify the `{{elseif ...}}` or `{{else}}` if you don't need them.

\note{
  The conditional blocks are fairly basic; in particular operations between page variables are not supported, so you can't write something like `{{if hasmath && hascode}}`.
  For more complex use cases, consider defining your own HTML functions using the [utils file](/syntax/utils/).
}

You can also use some dedicated conditional blocks:

@@lalign
| Format | Role |
| :----: | :--: |
| `{{ispage path/to/page}}` | whether the current page corresponds to the path
| `{{isnotpage path/to/page}}` | opposite of previous
| `{{isdef vname}}` | whether `vname` is defined
| `{{isnotdef vname}}` | opposite of previous
| `{{isempty vname}}`| whether `vname` is nothing, empty, or if a date `0001-01-01`
| `{{isnotempty vname}}`| opposite of previous
@@

The `{{ispage ...}}` and `{{isnotpage ...}}` accept `*` as joker symbol; for instance `{{ispage maths/*}}` is allowed.

**Note**: for people used to `C` syntax, you can also use `ifdef`, `ifndef`.

Consider the following example (very similar to what is used on the current page):

```html
<li class="{{ispage syntax/*}}active{{end}}">• Syntax
<ul>
  <!-- ... -->
  <li class="{{ispage syntax/page-variables}}active{{end}}">Page Variables
  <!-- ... -->
</ul>
```

This is a simple way of having a navigation menu that is styled depending on which page is currently active.

### For loops

You can define iterable page variables (array, tuple, ...) and loop over them using the following syntax:

```html
{{for x in vname}}
  ...{{fill x}}...
{{end}}
```

Only `{{fill vname}}` and `{{fill vname rpath}}` are allowed in such a for loop. You can also unpack an iterable like

```html
{{for (x, y) in vname}}
  ...{{fill x}}...{{fill y}}
{{end}}
```

where `vname` would refer to something like `[(1,2),(3,4)]`.

## Global page variables

The table below list global page variables that you can set.
These variables are best defined in your `config.md` file though you can overwrite the value locally by redefining the variable on a given page (this will then only have an effect on that page).

## Local page variables

The tables below list local page variables that you can set.
These variables are typically set locally on a page.
Remember that:

- you can also define your own variables (with different names),
- you can change the default value of a variable by defining it in your `config.md`.

Note that variables shown below that have a name starting with  `fd_` are _not meant to be defined_ as their value is typically computed on the fly (but they can be used).
